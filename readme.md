# Responding to the Call: Exploring Automatic Music Composition Using a Knowledge-Enhanced Model
This is the dataset and code implementation of AAAI2024 paper "Responding to the Call: Exploring Automatic Music Composition Using a Knowledge-Enhanced Model".

## CRD Dataset Zip File Structure
* Download CRD Dataset (19,155 Call-Response pairs): https://drive.google.com/file/d/15eX4hl1S2HpOlZ9wdaRA7j4J_resRAYr/view?usp=drive_link

## Data Processing Script
We also provide data preprocessing scripts. It will allow you to quickly process CRD Files (Midi) into the Compound Word representation as like [Compound Word Transformer](https://github.com/YatingMusic/compound-word-transformer).

## Code
This folder contains the necessary codes and tutorials for running the model. We include a subset of the dataset for code demonstration. 

## Demo
We also provide a demo of machine-composed responses.
